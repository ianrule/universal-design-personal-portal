                <h2>About Ian Rule</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Ian Rule, and I am a fifth-year engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am currently pursuing a B.S. (Bachelor of Science) in Computer Science in hopes to work in the field of software development. I am very passionate about technological innovation and the problems it can solve, and I love to evolve with new technology. In my free time, I enjoy DJing, mental health advocacy, working out, being outdoors, spending time with family and friends, listening to music, traveling, and taking in all of the knowledge this world has to offer. I am truly blessed to live the life that I do, and I want to leave as positive of an impact as I can on this world.</p>

            <h2>DJing</h2>
            <p>Music has always been a source of joy, support, and connection in my life. I found myself inspired by artists like Skrillex and Martin Garrix growing up and hoped to one day explore the art of DJing. I decided to pursue my interest in highschool by taking lessons with DJ Walt White at Global DJ Academy. In 2017, I purchased my first DJ controller and was able to enhance my skills by learning from my good friend TJ (who previously produced for a duo by the name of Krowd Ktrl). That same year, I performed at Skylab, a music event hosted by Global Dance. Since Skylab, I have done more live performances and have released mixes on SoundCloud under the alias “Dr. Slyme” (now “Eye Roll”).</p>

            <h2>Mental Health</h2>
            <p>After losing both my uncle and sister to suicide before the end of middle school, I was made well aware of how important mental health is at a young age. I have battled both an anxiety disorder and depression myself. I have tried many different forms of therapy and have participated in multiple inpatient and outpatient programs. My journey has been far from easy, but I have learned so much about myself and mental health as a whole because of it. I have volunteered for multiple non-profit organizations in the mental health industry and do the best I can to share my wisdom with those around me.</p>
