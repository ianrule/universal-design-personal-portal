                    Electric Daisy Carnival, commonly known as EDC, is an electronic dance music festival organized by promoter and distributor Insomniac.
                    The annual flagship event, EDC Las Vegas, is held in May at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and is currently the largest electronic dance music festival in North America.[1]                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The event features electronic dance producers and DJs, and incorporates a variety of electronic music, including house, techno, drum and bass, and dubstep.[2]
                    In addition to the music, event goers experience three-dimensional superstructures, colorful glow-in-the-dark environments, and LED-lit flora and fauna.[3]
                    There are also interactive art installations throughout EDC, free-roaming carnival performers, and carnival rides.[3]

                    Since its inception, other EDC events have been held in other states and abroad, including Mexico, Puerto Rico, the UK, Brazil, Japan and India.
                    Currently, EDC is held annually in Orlando, China, and Mexico, along with the main Las Vegas event.[4]
                    Sponsors of the most recent EDC events include Corona, Smirnoff, Uber and Tinder.[5]

                    In 2009, EDC became a two-day event, and in 2011, a three-day event that drew 230,000 people.
                    In 2015, it drew more than 400,000 over three days (134,000 per day).[6][7][8]
                    In 2018, EDC Las Vegas expanded the festival to include an on-site camping experience.
                    Recent iterations of the festival have featured eight stages, each with a unique set and specific genre of EDM.[9]
                    18 carnival rides, four ferris wheels, and a staff of more than 5,000 people make up the event at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.[10]
                    In 2019, access to purchasing tickets to EDC was expanded to mobile phone apps for convenience.
                    In 2017, EDC won the Festival of the Year award at the Electronic Music Awards.

                        EDC Los Angeles had an attendance of about 185,000 people.
                        Though tickets were starting at $60, some attendees paid over $100 per ticket.[17]
                        It drew criticism from local authorities and promoters after people under the required age of 16 gained entrance, and more than 100 ravers were hospitalized after a crowd stampede.
                        A 15-year-old attendee, Sasha Rodriguez, died after taking MDMA, a psychoactive drug.[18]
                        The city of Los Angeles placed a suspension on all remaining events scheduled for 2010 and for future events, pending the outcome of the new security and safety provisions.
                        The new provisions included the hiring of on-site doctors, and stated attendees must be over 18 years of age.[citation needed]
                        An EDC Colorado event was held on June 12 at the Arapahoe County Fairground in Aurora.[citation needed]
                        EDC Dallas was held on June 19 at Fair Park in Dallas. 11,000 people were in attendance.[citation needed]

                        In 2011, due to the previous controversy of EDC's former residence in Los Angeles, EDC moved its flagship festival to Las Vegas, Nevada.[19]
                        The event was held at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway from June 24-26.
                        Reportedly 230,000 people had attended the 3 day festival.[20]
                        EDC Orlando 2011 was held on May 27-28 at Tinker Field, and the grounds adjacent to the Florida Citrus Bowl.[21]

                        Electric Daisy Carnival Dallas was held June 18 at Fair Park with an estimated 25,000 attendees.
                        Temperatures above 110 degrees led to dozens of hospitalizations and at least one death, which made it the last EDC held in Dallas.
                        EDC Puerto Rico took place in San Juan at the Estadio Sixto Escobar on August 27[23]

                        In 2012, the three-day EDC in Vegas (June 8-10) saw attendance increase by 30%, to a total of 320,000 attendees.[24]
                        A 31-year-old male from Florida died after being struck by a truck as he left EDC at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on June 11.
                        Friends reported that he had been drinking and smoking.[25]
                        The second night had to shut down early at 1 a.m. due to high winds, of up to 30 MPH that started around 8 p.m.[26]
                        90,000 fans were directed to the speedway's bleachers.
                        DJs Markus Schulz and Steve Aoki, who were both scheduled to play that night, performed impromptu sets on the Insomniac Wide Awake art car, a much smaller, mobile stage, for a short period,[27] before officials ordered it to close as potentially dangerous winds were expected until 5 a.m.[28]
                        In order to make up for the cancellation, Insomniac allowed those with Saturday passes to return on Sunday.[29]
                        EDC Orlando was held at Tinker Field on November 9-10.
                        This coincided with the annual Dayglow event in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, called "Dancegiving" held the weekend after Thanksgiving.[citation needed]
                        EDC New York was held May 18-20 at the MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey.[30]
                        Although the venue was located in New Jersey, the festival was coined Electric Daisy Carnival New York due to the proximity to New York City.[31]
                        The event drew 45,000 attendees per day.[32]

                        Insomniac Events announced that all 345,000 tickets to the three-day festival had been sold by June 18, 2014.[33]
                        At the conclusion of the 2014 event, the massive three-day festival drew in roughly 134,000 per day.[34]
                        The setup at the event also led Insomniac to set the record for the largest structural stage in North America.[35]
                        EDC events were also held in Milton Keynes, England, San Juan, Orlando, Florida, and New York.[citation needed]

                        The festival also introduced on-site camping (including rentable campers and RV parking) and earlier opening times in order to reduce traffic congestion.[52][53]
                        An estimated 411,400 people attended the festival over the three days.[54]
                        EDC Mexico in Mexico City was planned for February 24-25 at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.[55]
                        EDC Japan was held in Chiba, Japan May 12 & 13 at Zozo Marine Stadium and Makuhari Beach Park.
                        Heavy Rains caused equipment issues.[56]

                        In 2019, EDC Las Vegas returned to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway for May 17-19.
                        On the second day, high winds forced stage closures.
                        Due to wording of the message displayed on screens, and the played audio message instructing them to "take cover in your car", some attendees were led to believe that the entire festival was being shut down for the night and subsequently left the speedway.
                        Upon learning at the exit that only certain areas were closed for safety precautions some people tried to re-enter the grounds but were not allowed back in due to the event's strict no-reentry policy.[57]
                        Las Vegas police announced 65 arrests during the festival, including 2 DUIs and 51 felony or gross misdemeanor arrests.[58]
                        EDC Mexico in Mexico City returned to Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez for February 23-24, 2019.[59]
                        EDC Orlando is now held for 3 days, instead of the normal 2 days. 
                        It will remain at Tinker Field, outside of Camping World Stadium. 
                        EDC Japan was held in Chiba on May 11 & 12, 2019 at ZOZO Marine Stadium & Makuhari Beach Park.[60] 
                        EDC Korea was held on 31 August & 1 September at Seoul Land, Gwacheon, South Korea.

                    <p>
                        In 2020, EDC Mexico in Mexico City was held at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez for February 28-March 2.
                        It was announced that the 2020 festival would utilize more of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway grounds, with Rotella pointing out that the speedway had removed a large number of RV hookups that had made certain areas of the grounds unusable.[61]
                        The festival was originally scheduled to take place from May 15-17, but was rescheduled for October 2-4.
                        However, in July 2020, the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[62]
                        A virtual festival, streamed live on Twitch and YouTube, took place during the original scheduled dates.[63]

                        In 2021, EDC Las Vegas was originally scheduled to be held from May 21-23.
                        However. Clark County on April 20 passed a reopening plan that requires 60% of their residents to be vaccinated before restrictions over large scale gatherings such as EDC can be lifted.[64]
                        In a statement released on social media, Insomniac Events CEO Pasquale Rotella stated, "Unfortunately, the rate at which people get vaccinated before EDC is out of our control.
                        It might happen in time, it might not.
                        Either way, we can't take that risk."[65]
                        The event instead took place from October 22-24.[66] 
                        The Electronic Dance Music (EDM) festival had the most number of attendees in Las Vegas, with an average of around 104,000 people attending each night.
                        During this time span, the medical district provided care to 2,673 different patients.
                        The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 42 years old, with a median age of 22.
                        Intoxication from alcohol or drugs, dehydration and dizziness, or trauma were the primary causes of patients seeking medical attention at the urgent care center.[67]
