                <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
                <h3>Definition of Universal Design</h3>
                <p>In his book Universal Design for Digital Media, Howard Kramer defines Universal Design as a design approach that <q>considers the needs of the diverse range of abilities of users in order to create a design that meets the needs of as many people as possible, including people with disabilities</q>. The key point made in Kramer's definition is that Universal Design encompasses more than the design of products for the disabled: it is a design mindset where every unique type of human being is accounted for in a product's design to the best of a designer's ability.</p>

                    <summary>A deep dive into the <abbr title="Universal Design">UD</abbr> definition</summary>
                    <p>Human beings are unique in many different ways including, but not limited to, their physical abilities, mental abilities, intellect, and age. Universal Design acknowledges the spectrum that each of these human characteristics lie on and urges designers to make products that are usable <q cite="https://universaldesign.ie/about-universal-design/definition-and-overview">to the greatest possible extent, in the most independent and natural manner possible [from a user's point of view], in the widest possible range of situations, and without the need for specialized solutions</q> <cite>(Disability Act 2005)</cite>. It is important to note here that Universal Design acknowledges that some disabled individuals must use specialized technology (a person who is blind needs to use a screen reader for example). However, <abbr title="Universal Design">UD</abbr> instructs designers to bake support for specialized technology into the primary design of their products instead of adding them on as an afterthought.</p>

                <h3>The 7 Principles of Universal Design</h3>
                <p>The definition of Univesal Design was further supplemented by the creation of the 7 Principles of Universal Design in 1997 by a group of professionals at North Carolina State University <cite>(Centre for Excellence in Universal Design)</cite>; these principles aid designers in developing a deep understanding of the <abbr title="Universal Design">UD</abbr> mindset. The 7 Principles of Universal Design are: equitable use, flexibility in use, simple and intuitive use, perceptible information, tolerance for error, low physical effort, and size and space for approach and use.</p>

                    <p>Principles 1 and 2 are sometimes difficult to distinguish between. The equitable use principle states that designs should be equal in their appeal and apparent usefulness to all people regardless of a person's unique demographic profile and abilities. On the other hand, the flexibility of use principle states that designs should offer multiple methods of user interaction to accommodate for the variety in human preferences and abilities. Principle 3, simple and intuitive use, states that designs should be simple enough for users of varying intellectual abilities to learn and utilize. The definition of the remaining principles is more straightforward; designs should be fully perceptible in their display of information, error proof, conducive for physical comfort, and reasonably sized for users of varying physical and cognitive abilities.</p>
