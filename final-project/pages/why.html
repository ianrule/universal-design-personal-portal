                <h2>Why is Universal Design Important?</h2>
                <h3>Increasing the Inclusivity of Society</h3>
                <p>Imagine a time in your life where you felt rejected. You may be picturing a person in your past that you had strong feelings for, but those feelings weren't reciprocated. You may be picturing a job opportunity that you worked so hard for, but you did not get. Or, you may be picturing a time you were were brave enough to be yourself around other people, and you were met with disgust or disapproval. Most of us have dealt with rejection at some point in our lives, and often the feeling of rejection is something that haunts us in some, way, shape or form; it is a feeling that is can be so intense that we remember the feeling years after it occurs. For some people, rejection is a unavoidable feeling in their daily lives as direct result of product design. The difficulty or inability to use a popular product can make a person feel rejected from society and accentuate feelings they may have that their unique set of abilities is problematic. This is where the importance of Universal Design becomes apparent: by making a conscious effort to to design products for all people, including those with disabilities, we can minimize the amount of people who suffer from feelings of rejection in their daily lives and increase the inclusivity of our society. Life is challenging enough as is and has only continued to become more complex; the products we design should not be the source of someone's experience of rejection.</p>
                <h3>Expansion of Product Reach</h3>
                <p>From a business perspective, the adoption of Universal Design is extremely beneficial. Logically, if a product is usable by all people regardless of physical or cognitive ability, its reach is much more likely to increase. Additionally, a demographic shift is on the horizon that businesses should be prepared for: the number of people who are elderly and the number of people with physical and cognitive impairments is increasing. According to the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design a “2022 national census found the number of people over 80 years of age increased by 25% since the 2016 census” and a <q cite="https://universaldesign.ie/about-universal-design/benefits-and-drivers">2022 national census percentage of persons with disabilities was 22% up from 15% in the 2016 census</q>. A focus on Universal Design not only insures that these increasing sectors of society are accounted for in product design and reach, but it also insures that a product's lifespan is more sustainable long-term <cite>(Centre for Excellence in Universal Design)</cite>.</p>
