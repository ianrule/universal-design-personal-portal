            <p>When people first hear the term “universal design”, they often associate it with design for the disabled. However, Universal Design encompasses much more than just accessible design; it is the concious effort a designer makes to design products that anyone in society can use regardless of factors including, but not limited to, age, intellect, and or ability. Universal Design is a valuable practice for a number of reasons: it can help companies expand their customer base and it produces a more inclusive space for everyone. The purpose of this educational site is to clearly define what Universal Design is, thoroughly outline why Universal Design is an important practice, and provide a how to Universal Design guide for web developers and designers.
